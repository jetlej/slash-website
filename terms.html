		<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

		<p>Welcome to Task Slayer!</p>

		<p>Your use of the Task Slayer service (the "Service") is governed by this legal agreement (the "Terms"). The Service is provided by Task Slayer, LLC ("Task Slayer").</p>

		<p>By using the Service, you are agreeing to these Terms. Please read them carefully.</p>

		<p>The Service is available to you if you are 13 years of age or older. If you are 13 or older, but under the age of majority in your country of residence, you must review this agreement with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand it. You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Task Slayer and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so.</p>

		<h2>Using our Service</h2>

		<p>You must follow any policies made available to you within the Service. You agree to use the Service only for purposes as permitted by these Terms.</p>

		<p>In order to use the Service, you need to establish an Account. You are solely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password. You are also responsible for all activities or actions exercised by your Account, and you should immediately notify Task Slayer if you learn of any unauthorized use of your Account. Please note that we may delete accounts (and all associated Content) that haven’t been used for an extended period of time.</p>

		<p>Using our Service does not give you any legal right, title, or interest in our Service or the Content you access. You may not assign (or grant a sub-license of) your rights to use the Service, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the Service. The Service, including the software used to implement the Service, as well as the software provided to you as a part of the Service (the "Software"), are protected by copyright, trademark, applicable intellectual property and other laws. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any trademarks, branding, or logos used in our Service. No portion of the Service may be reproduced in any form or by any means, except as expressly permitted in these Terms.</p>

		<p>Don’t misuse our Service. You agree not to engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Service (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service). Also, you agree not to access the Service using a method other than the interface and instructions we provide. For example, you may not: a) reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the software used to access the Service or protocols used in the Service, unless this is required by law; b) attempt to disable or circumvent any security mechanisms used by the Service; c) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network; d) breach or otherwise circumvent any security or authentication measures; e) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Service; f) interfere with or disrupt any user, host, or network, for example by sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing any part of the Service; g) plant malware or otherwise use the Service to distribute malware; h) access or search the Service by any means other than our publicly supported interfaces (for example, "scraping"). If your use of the Service or other behavior intentionally or unintentionally threatens our ability to provide the Service, we will take any reasonable steps to protect the Service, which may include suspension of your access to the Service.</p>

		<p>We may provide you with notices regarding the Service, including changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Website and/or Service.</p>

The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating and improving our Service, and to develop new ones. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any Content that you submit to our Service. We may remove any Content from our Service at our discretion.</p>

You agree that the license herein permits Task Slayer to take any such actions.</p>

		<p>You can stop using the Service at any time, although we would be sorry to see you go. Task Slayer may also stop providing the Service to you at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. For example, we may immediately suspend or terminate your use if you are not complying with these Terms, or use the Service in any way that would cause us legal liability or disrupt others’ use of the Service.</p>

		<p>If we suspend or terminate the Service or your Account, we will try to give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service. After a period of time, however, Task Slayer may permanently delete the Content that is associated with your Account.</p>

		<p>CULTURED CODE MAKES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SERVICE INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

		<h2>About these Terms</h2>

		<p>Please note that the Terms of Service may change from time to time. We will post notice of modifications on our website. In the case of substantial changes, we may, at our sole discretion, provide a prominent notice, e.g., using a dialog in the Task Slayer application, or by sending you an email with the updated Terms. You understand and agree that if you use the Service after the date on which the Terms have changed, Task Slayer will treat your use of the Service as acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

		<p>Certain components of the Service provided by Task Slayer may require separate Software or other license agreements or Terms of Use. You must read, accept, and agree to be bound by any such separate agreements as a condition of using these particular components or features of the Service.</p>

		<p>If you do not comply with these Terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>

		<p>These Terms control the relationship between you and Task Slayer, they don’t create any third party beneficiary rights.</p>

		<p>Upon any termination of the Service under Section "Modifying and Terminating our Service", these Terms will also terminate, but Sections "Exclusion of Warranties", "Limitation of Liability", "Indemnity" , and "About these Terms" shall continue to be effective after these Terms are terminated.</p>

		<p>This is the entire agreement between you and Task Slayer with respect to the Service and it supersedes and replaces any prior representations, discussions, undertakings, communications or advertising relating to the Service. If any part of this agreement is found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect, and enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.</p>

		<p>This agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws in force in Germany if the Service is used by a Customer having its seat in a member state of the European Union. The respective courts of Germany competent for Task Slayer’s seat shall have jurisdiction over all disputes relating to this agreement; however Task Slayer may file legal actions as well at the seat of the Customer.</p>
